  <p><b><u>Radiohead is a highly influential English rock band formed in 1985,</u></b> for their constant evolution and groundbreaking approach to music.<br> 
  <br>After gaining initial global fame with the grunge-inflected hit <u>"Creep,"</u> the band quickly transcended their early sound.<br>
  
  <br>They became known for their complex and ambitious albums, like the critically acclaimed OK Computer, which explored themes of modern alienation and technology.<br>
  
  <br>With later albums such as Kid A, Radiohead dramatically shifted their style, incorporating electronic music, jazz, and ambient soundscapes into their work.<br> 
  
  <br>This willingness to experiment and challenge conventional rock structures cemented their status as a genre-defying force.<br>
  <br>The band's consistent lineup of Thom Yorke, Jonny and Colin Greenwood, Ed O'Brien, and Phil Selway has been at the forefront of alternative and art rock for decades, influencing countless artists and maintaining a reputation for both sonic innovation and lyrical depth.<br></p>
